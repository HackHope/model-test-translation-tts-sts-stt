# Edge AI Speech & Translation Testing

This repository is for experimenting with different **Translation**, **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, **Speech-to-Text (STT)**, and **Speech-to-Speech (STS)** models on **edge devices**.  
The goal is to benchmark performance, latency, and quality across multiple open-source and lightweight models.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Test multiple **translation models** for multilingual support.  
- Compare **TTS** (text-to-speech) engines for natural, human-like voices.  
- Evaluate **STT** (speech-to-text) accuracy across languages.  
- Explore **STS** (speech-to-speech) pipelines directly on device.  
- Designed for **low-resource / edge hardware** (Mobile devices, generally speaking (Android and IOS)).
